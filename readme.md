# My Hope

- My Hope: My ultimate project combining creative coding ( CSS art, canvas j 2D, three js 3D) with practical features ( form with validation, todo app, clock's, etc ..).

- I created an image using CSS art for this project.

- All effects is custom js ( as like typed js library).

- Fully responsive design with device prioritization: effects & animations are adapted or disabled based on device width for better perfomance ( example: alarm clock switches to digital clock below 700px ).
